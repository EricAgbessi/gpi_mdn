If you want\n          to update any color, find the corresponding variable for thise color\n          and place theme to _user-variables.scss file.

If you change any color you have to assign\n          it's corresponding RGB color too. Please note sometimes you may need\n          to update corresponding component's CSS variable. For example:\n        </p>\n\n        <FalconEditor code={cssVariables} language=\"scss\" hidePreview />\n      </FalconComponentCard.Body>\n    </FalconComponentCard>\n\n    <FalconComponentCard>\n      <FalconComponentCard.Header\n        title=\"Compiling SCSS\"\n        light={false}\n        noPreview\n      />\n      <FalconComponentCard.Body>\n        <p>\n          Run <code>npm run build:css</code> command in your project directory\n          to compile scss.

React Table is a collection of hooks for <strong>building powerful tables and datagrid experiences</strong>. These hooks are lightweight, composable, and ultra-extensible, but <strong>do not render any markup or styles for you</strong>. This effectively means that React Table is a \"headless\" UI library\"`}\n      className=\"mb-3\"\n    >\n      <Button\n        href=\"https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/overview\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        variant=\"link\"\n        size=\"sm\"\n        className=\"ps-0\"\n      >\n        React Table Documentation\n        <FontAwesomeIcon icon=\"chevron-right\" className=\"ms-1 fs--2\" />\n      </Button>\n    </PageHeader>\n\n    <FalconComponentCard>\n      <FalconComponentCard.Header title=\"Example\" light={false} />\n      <FalconComponentCard.Body\n        code={exampleCode}\n        scope={{\n          AdvanceTableWrapper,\n          AdvanceTable,\n          AdvanceTableFooter\n        }}\n        language=\"jsx\"\n        noInline\n        noLight\n      />\n    </FalconComponentCard>\n\n    <FalconComponentCard>\n      <FalconComponentCard.Header\n        title=\"Pagination with numbering\"\n        light={false}\n      />\n      <FalconComponentCard.Body\n        code={paginationNumberingCode}\n        scope={{\n          AdvanceTableWrapper,\n          AdvanceTable,\n          AdvanceTablePagination\n        }}\n        language=\"jsx\"\n        noInline\n        noLight\n      />\n    </FalconComponentCard>\n\n    <FalconComponentCard>\n      <FalconComponentCard.Header\n        title=\"Searchable Table\"\n        light={false}\n        className=\"border-bottom border-200\"\n      />\n      <FalconComponentCard.Body\n        code={searchableTableCode}\n        scope={{\n          AdvanceTableWrapper,\n          AdvanceTable,\n          AdvanceTableFooter,\n          AdvanceTableSearchBox\n        }}\n        language=\"jsx\"\n        noInline\n        noLight\n      />\n    </FalconComponentCard>\n\n    <FalconComponentCard>\n      <FalconComponentCard.Header\n        title=\"Custom Cell\"\n        light={false}\n        className=\"border-bottom border-200\"\n      />\n      <FalconComponentCard.Body\n        code={customCellCode}\n        scope={{\n          AdvanceTableWrapper,\n          AdvanceTable,\n          AdvanceTableFooter,\n          AdvanceTableSearchBox\n        }}\n        language=\"jsx\"\n        noInline\n        noLight\n      />\n    </FalconComponentCard>\n\n    <FalconComponentCard>\n      <FalconComponentCard.Header\n        title=\"Selection\"\n        light={false}\n        className=\"border-bottom border-200\"\n      />\n      <FalconComponentCard.Body\n        code={selectionCode}\n        scope={{\n          AdvanceTableWrapper,\n          AdvanceTable,\n          AdvanceTableFooter,\n          IconButton\n        }}\n        language=\"jsx\"\n        noInline\n        noLight\n      />\n    </FalconComponentCard>\n  </>\n);\n\nexport default AdvanceTableExamples;\n","import React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { CloseButton, Modal } from 'react-bootstrap';\nimport { useNavigate, useLocation } from 'react-router';\nimport RegistrationForm from 'components/authentication/RegistrationForm';\n\nexport default function Example() {\n  let {\n    state: { open }\n  } = useLocation();\n  const navigate = useNavigate();\n\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(open);\n\n  const handleClose = () => {\n    setShow(false);\n    navigate(-1);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Modal show={show} onHide={handleClose} className=\"mt-4\">\n      <Modal.Header className=\"bg-shape modal-shape-header px-4 position-relative\">\n        <div className=\"position-relative z-index-1 light\">\n          <h4 className=\"mb-0 text-white\" id=\"authentication-modal-label\">\n            Register\n          </h4>\n          <p className=\"fs--1 mb-0 text-white\">\n            Please create your free Falcon account\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <CloseButton\n          variant=\"white\"\n          className=\"position-absolute end-0 me-2 mt-2 top-0\"\n          onClick={handleClose}\n        />\n      </Modal.Header>\n      <Modal.Body className=\"p-4\">\n        <RegistrationForm layout=\"split\" hasLabel />\n      </Modal.Body>\n    </Modal>\n  );\n}\n","import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid';\n\nconst today = new Date().getDate().toString().padStart(2, '0');\n\nlet currentMonth = (new Date().getMonth() + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0');\nconst nextMonth = (currentMonth + 1).toString().padStart(2, '0');\nconst prevMonth = (currentMonth - 1).toString().padStart(2, '0');\nconst currentYear = new Date().getUTCFullYear();\n\nconst events = [\n  {\n    id: uuid(),\n    title: 'Boot Camp',\n    start: `${currentYear}-${currentMonth}-01 10:00:00`,\n    end: `${currentYear}-${currentMonth}-03 16:00:00`,\n    description:\n      \"Boston Harbor Now in partnership with the Friends of Christopher Columbus Park, the Wharf District Council and the City of Boston is proud to announce the New Year's Eve Midnight Harbor Fireworks!
